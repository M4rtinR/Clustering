# EM Clustering Algorithm

This repo contains the code of the Expectation Maximization-based clustering algorithm adapted slightly from [1]. It has been used to cluster the observation data obtained from human-human interactions of professional squash coaches and stroke physiotherapists. These observations produced action sequences (e.g. pre-instruction, praise, concurrent instruction (positive), positive modelling, questioning, post instruction (positive)) from which transisiton matrices were produced. These transition matrices are used as the data points as input to this clustering program.

The full process is explained further in the paper's below.
